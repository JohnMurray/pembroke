# Installation

Currently Pembroke does not support any package managers, have an install script, or provide
any sort of easy installation path. This project is currently a W.I.P. and this is the price
you pay.

To get started with Pembroke you'll need to checkout the code, install the dependencies with
[Conan](conan.io), and build with cmake (standard commands are sufficient). You can then add
the `include` folder to your include-path and link against the compiled library.

Once the project is ready for a stable release/announcement, the installation process will
be addressed.
